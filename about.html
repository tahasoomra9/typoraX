            <h1>Hello, World.</h1>
            
            <p>
                I'm <span class="Taha">Taha</span>, a <strong>second-year Computer Science student</strong> working through the fundamentals and building things that interest me along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>TyporaX</strong> started because I wanted to understand how typing websites work. I've used them for years, and building one from scratch seemed like the best way to learn what happens under the hood. The clean aesthetic and focus on the typing experience made it a project worth spending time on.

            <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
            <p>
                Outside of programming, I spend my time on a few things I'm consistently working to improve:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Training:</strong> I lift naturally and focus on progressive overload. The process of tracking numbers and beating them keeps me disciplined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Guitar:</strong> I've been learning for a while now, working through songs and techniques that used to feel impossible. The satisfaction when something finally clicks is unmatched.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>3D Art:</strong> I create game assets and product visualizations as a hobby. Modeling, texturing, and rendering give me a different creative outlet from programming, and I enjoy the overlap when building game projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gaming:</strong> I've been playing games my entire life. They're how I unwind, and often where I find inspiration for what to build next.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>
                I learn by building things and breaking them along the way. This site isn't perfect, but it represents where I am right now in my journey, and I'm satisfied with what I've created so far.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you find it useful or enjoyable, that's a bonus.
